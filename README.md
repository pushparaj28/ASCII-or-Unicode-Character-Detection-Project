# ASCII-or-Unicode-Character-Detection-Project
Project Overview: This project is a simple web-based application that detects whether an entered character belongs to the ASCII character set (0-127) or is a Unicode character. It helps users distinguish between standard ASCII characters and extended Unicode characters.

Features:

✅ User inputs a single character.
✅ Detects if the character is an ASCII (0-127) or Unicode (128+).
✅ Displays results instantly.
✅ Simple and interactive UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


Technology Stack:
HTML → Structure
CSS → Styling
JavaScript → Logic for detection


How It Works:🧑‍💻
User enters a character in an input field.
JavaScript checks the character's Unicode value using charCodeAt(0).
If the value is between 0-127, it is an ASCII character.
If the value is 128 or above, it is a Unicode character.
The result is displayed dynamically.
