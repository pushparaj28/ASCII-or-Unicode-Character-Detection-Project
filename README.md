# ASCII-or-Unicode-Character-Detection-Project
Project Overview: This project is a simple web-based application that detects whether an entered character belongs to the ASCII character set (0-127) or is a Unicode character. It helps users distinguish between standard ASCII characters and extended Unicode characters.
